IRCSocket is an IRC wrapper around a TCPSocket. It implements all of the major
commands laid out in {RFC 2812}[http://irchelp.org/irchelp/rfc/rfc2812.txt].
All these commands are available as instance methods of an IRCSocket Object.

API documentation is available {here}[http://rdoc.injekt.net/irc-socket]

== Example
  irc = IRCSocket.new('irc.freenode.org')
  irc.connect

  if irc.connected?
    irc.nick "HulkHogan"
    irc.user "Hulk", 0, "*", "I am Hulk Hogan"

    while line = irc.read

      # Join a channel after MOTD
      if line.split[1] == '376'
        irc.join "#mychannel"
      end

      puts "Received: #{line}"
    end
  end

== Installation
  gem install irc-socket

Or alternatively you can clone the Github repository
  git clone https://github.com/injekt/irc-socket

== Notes
I may have missed something in the RFC. Patches welcome.
